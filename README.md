# MyPath

My Path is an interactive website that allows users to experience a choose-your-own-adventure while navigating through decisions in regards to their career and life path. Our approach gives users (student in particular) and more hands-on method to visualize possible paths and better understand their options.

My path was built primarily using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## History

MyPath was originally created for the TUHSD Hackathon we participated in the Spring of 2022. The Hackathon was school-district wide and organized by the local chapter of Girls Who Code.

We participated in the Intermediate Division and were asked to create something that we felt would improve the education system, based on our own experience. Our concept and website ended up winning 1st place in our division!

Having never worked on a project together before, we learned how to collaborate and work together as a team as we worked on this weekend Hackathon. We decided to make MyPath available on the internet and we will be pitching the website to our old high school to be used by teachers and students!
