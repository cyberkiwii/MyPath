              Hey! Thanks for checking out our website! We are a group of girls who code. Inspired by our own experiences and frustration during our education to answer the question, "What do you want to be when you grow up?", we worked together to create something that we hope can help others. Built on the concept of "choosing your own adventure", we built MyPath. 
              <br>
              <br>
              We would like to shout out GirlsWhoCode and the student chapter leaders for this hackathon opportunity! Thank you also to our teachers, workshop speakers, judges and sponsors :)

              Hello! I am a junior at Desert Vista High School. This is my second year in a programming class and my first hackathon. I love how creative you can be with programming, and I am interested to learn more about the graphical side of coding. I have previously worked with Java, HTML/CSS, Python, and VEX code. Last year, I joined the DV programming club, and this year, I am an officer of the club. Along with programming club, I also joined the robotics club where I learned how to write VEX code for the autonomous portion of a robotics competition. I love how programming can make machines come to life, and I can't wait to explore robotics further. After I graduate high school, I plan to double major in Computer Science and Biomedical Engineering to incorporate programming, robotics, and my passion for science. I hope our website makes deciding your future path slightly easier!

              Hey! I am a senior at Desert Vista High School. This is only my first year in a programming class and my first hackathon, but I have almost always been interested in IT and in design. When I was a freshman in high school I enjoyed working on websites with website builders, and now I know how to build them! I enjoy learning new things and my favorite languages to work with are Python, and HTML/CSS. I am also a 2nd year student at The East Valley Institute of Technology (EVIT) in Networking and Cyber Security. This project theme was something that felt meaningful for me because throughout high school I tried to seek out trade school options that I could do during high school, (which is later how I came to attend EVIT), but felt that there was a lack of information and support for those options. I hope that our site will help other high school students to "choose their own" life "adventure" and to better understand their options so that they can succeed.

              Hello! I am a senior at Desert Vista High School and this is my second year in a high school programming class and my first hackathon. I have always been interested in engineering and computer science, and I love building games and websites. I was interested in this hackathon because I enjoy using technology to advocate for positive change in society, and I have done this previously in a farm labor rights website I created last summer. I am planning to major in Computer Science at Arizona State University in the fall! This project was one that we felt would resonate with all students who are struggling to figure out what they want to do after high school.
